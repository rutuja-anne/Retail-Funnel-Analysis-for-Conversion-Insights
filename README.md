# 🛒 Retail Funnel Analysis Dashboard (Power BI + Python + SQL)

This project analyzes the end-to-end customer purchase funnel of a retail e-commerce business, uncovering drop-offs, behavioral patterns, and conversion trends across the buyer journey.  
It helps identify where customers are exiting the funnel and suggests data-driven improvements to boost conversions and revenue.

## 🚀 **Project Overview**

The goal of this project is to understand how users move through each stage of the shopping funnel — from **viewing products → adding to cart → purchasing** — and where they drop off.  

The dataset (UCI Online Retail Data, 2009–2011) was cleaned and preprocessed using **Python**, analyzed in **SQL**, and visualized through an interactive **Power BI dashboard**.

The analysis revealed a **55% drop-off rate at the browsing stage**, highlighting critical UX and marketing improvement opportunities.

## 📊 **Funnel Summary Example**

| Funnel Stage | Customers | Conversion % | Drop-off % |
|---------------|------------|---------------|-------------|
| Viewed Product | 2330 | 100% | - |
| Added to Cart | 1860 | 80% | 20% |
| Purchased | 1050 | 44.89% | 55.11% |

**Insight:** 55% drop-off at browsing stage due to lack of engagement and remarketing triggers.
